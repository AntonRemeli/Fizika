Some radiation and heat related reflections: <br>
<br>
Under sunlight irradiation (1kW/m<sup>2</sup>, peak wavelength 500nm
visible),
ordinary materials absorb almost all the incoming radiation, reflect
only 5-10% .<br>
To re-radiate that absorbed energy to the neighbourhood ordinary
materials with emissivity of 0.9 have to raise their temperature to
100C, <br>
painted surfaces with e=0.5 shall reach 160C to re-radiate 1kW,
aluminium-coated paper (e=0.2) 272C, aluminium-sheet (e=0.1) 375C, <br>
bright aluminium-foil (having the lowest emissivity e=0.05) will reach
almost 500C when radiating 1kW!<br>
<br>
All that is assumed to happen in the interstellar space, black coated
front-side absorbing 100% of insolation, covered with transparent
Polyethylene <br>
(e=0.1) that prevents infrared radiation to escape from the
front-side, thus emitting all the absorbed energy only from the
backside. <br>
<br>
On Earth's surface there is additional radiant heat source (with no
effect behind the transparent Polyethylene covert on front-side,
only at backside) : <br>
the surrounding objects that radiate 300-500W/m<sup>2</sup> (peak
wavelength 10um
infrared) at 0-30C ambient temperature (insolated objects radiate far
more). <br>
However, there is convective air-cooling on the front-side of the
surface, and conductive heat-transport to the backside of any surface. <br>
So could real surface temperatures reach approximately 60, 70, 80, 90
and 100C respectively, lower than the theoretical ones in interstellar
space: <br>

<br>
Each surface is adjacent to some mass, say 10cm concrete (having 200kg
weight, in thermal capacity equivalent to 40 litre water), <br>
hence the daily average 4kWh solar irradiation will raise the
temperature of the whole block to 100C (if no heat losses). <br>
However, convective air cooling (100m3 air heated by 10C will
bring a quarter of the daily accumulated heat away) <br>
heat conduction and thermal radiation lower the daily accumulated heat
of the insolated concrete plate to about 50C.<br>
<br>
If the insolated surface of the 10cm thick concrete plate (as=0.9)
reaches 50C, the acclimatised backside held at 20C, heat transport will
be 600W/m<sup>2</sup>.<br>
The usual 24W/m<sup>2</sup>K heat transfer coefficient for outer walls
with
35C outer temperature results 360W/m<sup>2</sup> heat dissipation by
convection
and radiation.<br>
<br>
By applying 10cm rock-wool instead of concrete, heat transport will
drop to only 12W/m<sup>2</sup> at the same temperature gradient,
<br>
only negligible fraction of the irradiated energy can be transported to
the backside, the irradiated surface will overheat from 50C to 75C. <br>
Due to this overheating the temperature gradient will raise to 55C
instead of 30C, hence heat transport will increase to 22W/m<sup>2</sup>
in place
of 12W/m<sup>2</sup>, <br>
radiative and convective heat-dissipation will raise from 360W/m<sup>2</sup>
to
960W/m<sup>2</sup> (applying the usual 24W/m<sup>2</sup>K outer surface
heat transfer
coefficient). <br>
<br>
<br>
Central European building with 300m2 outer surface, 100m2 of it
insolated: <br>
<br>
But even the very small amount of transmitted heat (22W/m<sup>2</sup>)
will result
in 2kW cooling demand for 100m2 insolated surface. <br>
Heating demand for 25C temperature difference during winter is
10W/m<sup>2</sup> with 10cm rock-wool insulation,<br>
hence for a 300m2 outer wall house it results a 3kW heating
demand, or 72kWh daily energy consumption. <br>
Calculating with average 1 hour daily solar insolation during
winter the energy consumption will be slightly lowered by
2+3kWh<br>
to 67kWh (although the only one hour of winter sunshine could deliver
100kWh heat to the 100m2 insolated house walls!). <br>
Assuming 100-150 winter days, yearly heating demand will reach
7-10.5MWh (23-35kWh/m<sup>2</sup> to 300m2 walls), <br>
100-150 summer days with average 10h daily insolation will yield 2-3MWh
(20-30kWh/m<sup>2</sup> to 100m2 insolated walls) yearly cooling
demand. <br>
Additionally there is the cooling demand for 5C temperature difference
during summer for 300m2 10cm rock-wool insulated
walls:<br>
2W/m<sup>2</sup> result 600W continual cooling demand, or 14.4kWh daily
energy consumption, about 1-2MWh (3-6kWh/m<sup>2</sup> to 300m2) yearly
cooling demand. <br>
<br>
Radiation Control Coatings <br>
(RCC, high solar reflectance, high thermal emittance) <br>
<br>
Applying reflective coating (rs=80% in place of 10%) on 100m2 insolated
surface will result in 400W cooling demand in place of
2kW,<br>
hence 100-150 summer days with average 10h daily insolation will yield
400-600kWh (4-6kWh/m<sup>2</sup> to 100m2 insolated walls) yearly
cooling demand. <br>
That reflective coating will in winter lower the insolation gain by
1.6kWh daily, increasing by 0.16-0.24MWh (1.6-2.4kWh/m<sup>2</sup>)
yearly heating
demand.<br>
<br>
So in place of 3-5MWh cooling demand for 300m2 walls we will get
1.4-2.6MWh just by applying a standard white calcium-carbonate
paint. <br>
The winter disadvantage of reflective coating is just 10% of the
summer cooling savings, hence it's worth to paint the insolated
surfaces white even in Central Europe. Reflective coatings bring far
more advantage in the Mediterranean, Tropical and Arid climate zones:
<br>
they can halve the 6-10MWh yearly cooling load of the 300m2 outer
surface, 100m2 insolated, 10cm rock-wool insulated
house.<br>
<br>
Wavelength dependent reflectance <br>
<br>
Focusing now on reflectivity, one has to take in account that for
different coatings reflectivity is wavelength dependent: <br>
Half of the solar energy comes in the visible region (300-700nm), the
other in the near-infrared (1-3μm). White colour has a 80% reflectance
of solar <br>
spectrum, darker colours have less reflectance, black has only 5%
reflectance. In the thermal infrared spectrum (3-40μm) all usual
colours are “black”. <br>
Thermal infrared ( far-infrared ) radiation spectrum extends from
wavelengths of 3 μm to 40 μm for surface temperatures between
+100 �C and –10 �C. <br>
<br>
Some substances generate high reflectance in the near-infrared (1-3μm)
region: TiO2 white paint reflects solar spectrum much better than the
usual <br>
carbonate white, and there are some special additives like InfraCool or
EnergyStar which enhance even more the near-infrared (1-3um)
reflectivity.<br>
Hollow glass/silica/ceramic microsphere additives of 10-100μm diameter
in acrylic colours claim to have high near-infrared reflectance. <br>
Darker colours (coming from an unfavourable starting point) will
benefit much more than lighter ones from the use of the near-infrared
reflecting paints. <br>
Pure white heat reflective paint will only provide a slight benefit to
using a conventional white paint. <br>
<br>
There is a 8 - 14 �m transmission window in the atmosphere that
is relatively independent of the moisture level such that heat can
effectively <br>
be removed from the surface, and even the whole building, by radiative
transfer processes – this atmospheric window is of crucial importance: <br>
Without the infrared atmospheric window, the Earth would become much
too warm to support life, and possibly so warm that it would lose its
water, <br>
as Venus did early in solar system history. Thus, the existence of an
atmospheric window is critical to Earth remaining a habitable
planet. <br>
<br>
The SkyCool case<br>
SkyCool (Wojtysiak patent 2002) is a highly reflective white paint
combined with a claimed high emissivity of et=at=0.94 at thermal
infrared (rt=0.06). <br>
Selective emissivity in the 8 to 13 μm region is achieved, at least in
part, with hollow microspheres, but Wojtysiak patent does not describe <br>
the mechanisms for enhancing emissivity. The thermal emissivity of
SkyCool coating is just slightly higher than that of usual surfaces
having <br>
emissivity of 0.9, hence practically no any advantage from its
implementation: all materials use this cosmic window to give heat
freely away <br>
without regard of the selective emissivity in the 8 to 13 μm region:
even surfaces with uniformly emissivity et=0.9 are forced to give heat
in the <br>
8 - 14 �m transmission window away, it is the only leak where heat can
escape. <br>
<br>
But, if the emissivity of SkyCool is really selective in the 8 - 14 �m
transmission window, so this coating should very poorly absorb thermal
infrared <br>
( far-infrared ) radiation outside this 8 - 14 �m transmission window,
and without hindrance re-emit most of the absorbed energy into
the 8 - 14 �m <br>
transmission window (ambient temperature spectral energy
peek). Assuming half of the ambient temperature thermal spectrum energy
being outside <br>
the 8 - 14 �m transmission window, SkyCool may absorb only 300W/m<sup>2</sup>
instead of 500W/m<sup>2</sup> thermal radiation of the hot summer-day
surroundings
<br>
(average thermal absorptivity being at=0.6, seemingly contradicting
Kirchoff's law et=0.94, but at=0.6 is meant for broader range 3 - 40�m,
et=0.94 <br>
is meant in the 8 - 14 �m transmission window).<br>
<br>
There is no spectral emittance graph published for SkyCoal, in
opposition to the 3M paints being thoroughly analysed in the
<br>
„Solar heat reflective paint &amp; coatings using 3MTM Glass Bubbles”
publication: The solar reflectance is calculated using the ASTM method
E903-96 <br>
and reference table for solar irradiance from ASTM G173-03. Thermal
emittance is measured according to NF EN 12898 standard using an ABB <br>
B3MEM MB-154S FTIR spectrometer and a gold coated integrated sphere
available from SphereOptics. <br>
From the thermal emittance graph one can see, that there is a slight
decrease in spectral emissivity outside the 8 - 14 �m transmission
window, <br>
hence any coating, even the most usual calcium carbonate CaC33 paint
can claim enhanced emissivity e=0.94 in the 8 - 14 �m transmission
window. <br>
<br>
Application of the SkyCoal reflective coating (rs=80% in place of 10%)
on 100m2 insolated surface will result in 400W cooling demand in place
of 2kW, <br>
and additional 200W/m<sup>2</sup> cooling gain if SkyCoal has really
selective
emissivity in the 8 to 13 μm atmospheric transmission
window,<br>
hence 100-150 summer days with average 10h daily insolation will halve
the 400-600kWh (4-6kWh/m<sup>2</sup>) yearly cooling demand due to
reflectivity only.<br>
Such a high, doubled cooling gain is not registered for SkyCoal in
comparison with other white coatings, so the claim of selective
emissivity in the 8 to <br>
13 μm atmospheric transmission window does not hold. Neither a humble
10 or 20% performance gain is registered in comparison with other
products. <br>
Cooling gain due to hollow ceramic or glass spheres is only few percent
when compared with the calcium carbonate CaC33 paint. <br>
<br>
Reflectance of these white coatings starts at the very high 97% in the
solar range by steadily decreasing to 50%, then further even to 5% in
the <br>
thermal range, quite opposite to the metallic surfaces. At 3-4 �m band
there is a temporary increase of reflectance from 5 to 30% and in the
6-6.5�m <br>
band from 4 to 12% for all coatings including the calcium carbonate
CaC33 paint too. These two bands of temporary increase of
reflectance for <br>
longer wavelengths might be the clue for warmer, condensation and
mold-free surfaces, but there is no need for special substances: it
will function <br>
equally well with the usual calcium carbonate CaC33 paint
too. <br>
<br>
And lastly there is very often the claim: „heat-reflective paint with
high reflectance in the infra-red to minimise the surface temperature
increase”. <br>
Infra-red is here meant to be the solar near-infrared, for thermal
infrared all these surfaces are „black”, highly absorptive, no thermal
reflectance. <br>
<br>
<br>
Interior Radiation Control Coating Systems <br>
(IRCCS, far-infrared emittance of 0.25 or less: high thermal
reflectance, low thermal emittance) <br>
<br>
A low-emittance paint or coating is available for use on interior
surfaces to reduce heat transfer between the interior air and the
coated surface.<br>
Radiant barriers ( shiny metallic surface with a far-infrared emittance
of 0.1 or less) are always installed with the reflective (low
emittance) <br>
surface facing an open air space. <br>
<br>
Because of a radiant barrier’s low emittance and high reflectance, it
can block about 90 – 97% of the radiant heat that strikes the surface, <br>
significantly reducing the total heat transfer in and out of a
building. <br>
<br>
Radiant Barriers and Reflective insulation products excel in hot
climates and often are the first choice for insulation in those
regions. <br>
However, they also provide significant benefits in cold climates where
they are used alone or in combination with other insulation
materials. <br>
<br>
Thus, except in sunlight,the colour of clothing makes little difference
as regards warmth; <br>
likewise, paint colour of houses makes little difference to warmth
except when the painted part is sunlit. <br>
The main exception to this is shiny metal surfaces, which have high
reflectance and low emissivities both in the visible wavelengths and in
the far infrared. <br>
Such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions;
an example of this is the multi-layer insulation used to insulate
spacecraft. </i><br>
